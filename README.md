A repository for a variety of Data Science "skill-builders".


-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Project Overview
The DSBC team has spent years developing tools and training materials for Applied Math and Data Science.
In this project you will find the following tools.
* ["Notes on ..."](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/math_notes) these are cheet sheets on various topics of math for Machine Learning, e.g. [algebra](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Algebra.pdf), [calculus](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Calculus.pdf), [probability theory](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Probability_Theory.pdf), etc., as well as Machine Learning topics, e.g. [linear regression](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Linear_Regression.pdf), [principle component analysis](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Principle_Component_Analysis.pdf), [hypothesis testing](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/math_notes/Hypothesis_Testing.pdf), etc.
* ["Cheat-Sheets"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/cheat_sheets) these are cheet sheets for various Python toolboxes, e.g. [Numpy](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/Numpy_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [MatPlotLib](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/MatPlotLib_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [SciKitLearn](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/SciKitLearn_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), [Keras](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/cheat_sheets/Keras_Cheat_Sheet.pdf), etc.
* ["10 steps to Data Science"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-DS) is a series of notebooks to teach you the most common tools used in Data Science.
* ["10 steps to Machine Learning"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/10-steps-to-ML) is a series of notebooks to teach you some advanced tools used in Machine Learning. 
* ["Python in 2 days"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Python-in-2-days) is a series of notebooks to get you started in Juypter notebooks and Python.
* ["Machine Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Machine-Learning-in-1-day) is a series of notebooks focused on a basic toolbox for Machine Learning.
* ["Deep Learning in 1 day"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Deep-Learning-in-1-day)  is a series of notebooks focused on advanced CNNs, RNNs, GANs and Transformers.
* ["Examples"](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks/Examples)  is a series of notebooks that most folks will find useful for a variety of reaal-life applications of Data Science.


## Machine Learning Flow-Chart
Our new [Hi-Res Machine Learning flow-chart](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/flow-chart/ML_flow_chart_HiRes.png) will help you navigate the enormous number of algorithms.  This will help you select what algorithm you need to complete your task, based on the data that you have and the desired outcome or story you are trying to tell.

## New to Python and Jupyter Notebooks?
Have you heard about Jupyter Notebooks, but dont know how to get started? Here is a quick tutorial.

* First, navigate to the [Anaconda website](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) to download the software and install it on your computer (PC or Mac).
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/anaconda.png">
</p>

* Now, download [this GitHub repo](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training) to your computer.
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/github.png">
</p>

* Un-zip the files to the following Anaconda default directory (for PC users): "C:\Users\(your user name)\Notebooks\".
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/directory.png">
</p>

* Open Anaconda, and click on the launch icon for Jupyter.  This will open the Jupyter UI in your web browser.
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/anaconda_ui.png">
</p>

* We recommend that you start with the "01_Notebooks.ipynb", but for this demo we click on the "02_Python.ipynb".
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/jupyter_ui.png">
</p>

* Once the notebook has opened in your browser, you can read through it and run each cell (to learn how to do this, go back to "01_Notebooks.ipynb").
<p align="center">
	<img width="500" src="https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/blob/master/media/python_notebook.png">
</p>

* You are now ready to tackle all of [our notebooks](https://github.com/dsbc2020/ml_training/tree/master/notebooks) for your self-paced training.  Enjoy!  We wish you great success in your journey to becomming a Data Scientist!
